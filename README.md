# Learner-Enagement-Analysis-Insights-into-Opportunities-and-Demographics-on-Excelerate

## Project Description
This project examines learner engagement with opportunities on Excelerate through a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and demographic evaluations. The aim is to uncover patterns in sign ups, completion rates, and learner characteristics, offering actionable insights for improving platform engagement and user success. The analysis also explores the relationship between demographic variables, learner progression, and performance outcomes.

## Objective
To analyze learner behavior and engagement patterns on Excelerate.
To investigate demographic influences on learner success and opportunity completion rates.
To identify key factors contributing to progression, dropouts, and high performance.
To provide data driven recommendations for enhancing platform strategies and user engagement.

## Dataset Used

## Key Questions
What are the main trends in opportunity sign ups and completion rates?
How do demographic characteristics (gender, country, and student status) influence engagement and performance?
What factors drive learner success, and what causes dropouts or rejections?
Is there a correlation between rewards and skill points earned?
Which opportunity categories yield the highest learner engagement and rewards?
How does social media impact user sign-ups and activity?

## Process
### Data Preparation and Cleaning:
Columns were separated using the 'Text to Columns' feature.
Dates were formatted for consistency.
Missing values in numerical columns (e.g., Reward Amount, Skill Points) were replaced with zeros.
Categorical columns were standardized (e.g., Gender, State).
Duplicates were checked and none were found.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Descriptive statistics for key columns (Reward Amount, Skill Points Earned).
Frequency distributions for categorical columns.
Opportunity status distribution analysis.
Visualizations: Bar charts, pie charts, and demographic distributions.

## Insights
### Opportunity Sign Up and Status Trends:
70% of learners progressed to the "Team Allocated" stage.
Only 12.6% reached "Rewards Awarded," while 6.5% dropped out or were rejected.
### Demographic Patterns:
